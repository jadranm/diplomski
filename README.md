The aim of this thesis was to create a mobile measuring device for measuring the concentration of carbon dioxide along a predefined pedestrian route. The need for such a device arises due to the numerous consequences of high concentrations of carbon dioxide on the environment and human health. The effects of poor air quality on human health are most pronounced in densely populated and urbanized areas due to heavy traffic and industrial activities. During measurements, the device automatically sends the measured data and the measurement location to a remote MySQL database to ensure secure storage and easy access for subsequent processing and analysis. The post-processing of measurements and visualization of results are done in the Microsoft Excel. In this thesis, both hardware and software support for the device have been developed. The hardware support is based on the ESP 32 WROOM microcontroller, while the software is based on the Arduino framework. The thesis includes the development of a custom program for the ESP 32 microcontroller in the Arduino framework, configuration of a remote MySQL database, and the development of a custom PHP script for data entry into the database.
